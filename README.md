# 1-Day Introduction to Practical AI & Machine Learning

Welcome! This repository contains all the official materials for the "1-Day Introduction to Practical AI & Machine Learning" workshop. Here you will find the presentation slides, datasets, and commented Jupyter Notebooks for our hands-on projects.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a clear, practical, and end-to-end understanding of how machine learning projects are executed in a real-world business context, moving from foundational concepts to building and deploying predictive models.

## Workshop Agenda

The training is structured into several modules, building from theory to hands-on application:

| Module | Title                                           | Description                                                                                             |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**  | **Foundations of AI**                           | Demystifying AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. We'll learn the core concepts and terminology.       |
| **2**  | **The End-to-End ML Project Blueprint**         | A step-by-step walkthrough of the standard 8-stage project lifecycle, from framing the problem to deployment. |
| **3**  | **AI Opportunities and Use cases** | Exploring how artificial intelligence and machine learning can transform operations.         |

### 2. Datasets

The datasets used in our hands-on projects are located in the `/datasets` directory.

*   `aggregate_annual_claims.csv`: Anonymized historical data for our forecasting project.
*   `sythetic_sample_claims.csv`: Anonymized individual claim data for our classification and regression project.
*   `easy_peasy.csv`: Anonymized individual claim data for predicting ultimate claim cost.

### 3. Hands-On Jupyter Notebooks

These notebooks contain the complete, commented Python code for our projects. They are designed to be run in sequence and serve as a detailed guide.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Environment

To follow along with the hands-on coding sessions, you will need a Python environment. We recommend one of the following options:

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended for Simplicity)

Google Colab provides a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that requires no local installation.

### Option 2: Local Setup with Anaconda

For those who prefer a local environment, we recommend using the Anaconda distribution.
